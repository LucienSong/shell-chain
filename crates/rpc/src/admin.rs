//! `admin_*` JSON-RPC namespace.
//!
//! Provides node administration methods for operators:
//!
//! - `admin_nodeInfo` — static metadata about this node instance.
//! - `admin_peers`    — list of currently connected P2P peers.
//! - `admin_addPeer`  — dynamically add a bootnode / dial-out peer.
//!
//! The `admin` namespace is **opt-in** via `--rpc-api admin` and should
//! **never** be exposed on a public endpoint without API-key protection.
